# SATurno  

**An educational Rust library for exploring and implementing SAT-Solver algorithms.**  

## Project Description  
SATurno aims to provide a learning platform for logical satisfiability problem-solving techniques. The project includes implementations of key algorithms, such as Tseitin transformations, and serves as a resource for understanding SAT-Solvers.  

This library is designed for educational purposes and experimentation rather than production use.  

## Project Structure  
- **`src/`**: Core library source code.  
- **`benches/`**: Performance benchmarks for algorithm evaluation.  
- **`examples/`**: Practical usage examples to demonstrate the library's features.  

## Requirements  
- Rust (stable version)  

## How to Run  
### Run Examples  
To execute a specific example:  
```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```  

### Run Benchmarks  
To execute benchmarks:  
```bash
cargo bench
```
